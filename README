Scripts from Virgo commissioning:

'DAC_noise' has code to estimate the DAC noise contribution to the Virgo sensitivity

'ER_tests' contains a few scripts to characterize the detector during engineering runs - things like Q measurements of solid-body modes, violin modes, lockloss investigations etc.

'sense_plot' has a plotting routines and data for visualizing the AdV sensitivity over time
