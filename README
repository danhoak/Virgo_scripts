Scripts  from Virgo commissioning:

DAC_noise estimates the DAC noise contribution to the Virgo sensitivity

ER_tests are a few scripts to characterize the detector during engineering runs - things like Q measurements of solid-body modes, violin modes, lockloss investigations etc.

sense_plot has a few plotting routines and data for visualizing the sensitivity
